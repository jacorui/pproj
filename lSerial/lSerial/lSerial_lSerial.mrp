GSR Usage
---------

GSR Component:
   The local reset signal 'debCom_inst/n14254' of the design has been inferred
        as Global Set Reset (GSR). The reset signal used for GSR control is
        'debCom_inst/n14254'.
        

     GSR Property:
   The design components with GSR property set to ENABLED will respond to global
        set reset while the components with GSR property set to DISABLED will
        not.
        

Run Time and Memory Usage

   Total CPU Time: 0 secs  
   Total REAL Time: 0 secs  
   Peak Memory Usage: 62 MB
